## Review

Linked List:  linear collection of nodes
Xavier: series of connected nodes that do not need to live in adjacent memory
Brandon: would add that it is linear

## Stack Data Structure

Stack: Data Structure with First in Last out behavior  (FILO)

Jun: vertical stack of nodes
Stephen:  a way of organizing data with a single, same entry point
Elaine: deck of cards. can only pull form the top
Keelen: FILO (or LIFO) 
Jack:  different flavor of linked list - linear
Robert: stack behavior or "the concept" can be gotten using other structures  

### Use Cases:  

- when order matters (clarify "matters")
- the call stack.  think recursion
- reverse things - first thing in will be the last thing out

## Queue Data Structure

Queue:  Data Structure with FIRST in FIRST out behavior (FIFO)
Stephen:  One entry (the back), and different and only one exit (the front)

### Use Cases:

- when order matters...
- we must make sure that the first concern is handled first
