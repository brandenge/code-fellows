# Trees

## Review

### Linear Data Structures

- Linked Lists  --- [BE ABLE TO TRAVERSE](https://replit.com/@rkgallaway/liinkedlist-traversal#index.js)
- Stacks
- Queues

## Overview

> Hierarchical - have a root, and branch out from there

## Terminology

- k-ary: each node has up to "k" number of children
  - examples:  family tree, 
- binary tree: each node has up to 2 (and no more) children
- balanced: nodes are inserted from top to bottom and maximum of one partially filled level
- leaf: node children
- edge: 
- edge weight: 
- path: the route taken from a starting node to an ending node (root -> leaf)
- path weight: ask for clarification - can be  generalized or tailored but an example could be the sum of all nodes from root to leaf
- binary search tree:  sorted binary tree.  lesser values to the left larger to values to right.  impacts efficiency

## Traversals

### Depth First Traversal 

> from root to leaf

- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order

be able to look at a tree diagram and just KNOW what the order would be

### Breadth First Traversal

> read all nodes on 1st level, then the second level, third, etc
