1. Authentication and Authorization with ACL
1. Event Driven programs with the Observer Pattern

## Cloud Computing

10 years ago...  this was totally a thing:  On-site servers that required a lot of diverse maintenance

### EC2 -> (ECC) -> (Elastic Compute Cloud)

What is an EC2 instance?
- Robert Ball:  Based on needs / requirements Virtual Machine - "environment"

Scalability:
- can more instance
- paired with Elastic beanstalk we can have automatic load balancing

Additional thoughts

Virtual Environment running on PHYSICAL Server Farm Hardware

- Create a virtual machine by provisioning resources from physical servers. Very fast and efficient, sit in between the Operating System and the underlying hardware. Allows seamless scalability between software and hardware.
- Environments can be accessible to other Amazon Services and the public.

### Elastic Beanstalk (Application Platform)

Web Application Platform on top of EC2 Virtual Environments

- Create a platform specific runtime application that can execute your source code.
- Configures an EC2 instance, pre-configured with the scale and maintain tools for your application type.
